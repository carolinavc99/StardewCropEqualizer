# Stardew Crop Equalizer

## What does it do?
**This program is made to work WITH the Agriculturist perk! If you don't have that perk, the results won't be accurate, since it speeds up crop growth!**

The *Stardew Crop Equalizer* calculates how many of each crop you need to plant in order to get the (approximately) same ammount of produce from each one, at the end of the month. So, for example, at the end of Spring, if you plant what this program tells you to, you will get 20 blue jazz, 20 cauliflower, 20 kale, etc. The results may vary since the crops all have different growth times, as well as random harvest multipliers, so don't expect perfect quantities each time.

If at the end of it there are still a lot of tiles to use, the program will divide them equally by all crops. This will skew the total yield since a few crops produce more than others, so there is an option to ignore those extra tiles for those that don't want this.
